# Education through a new lens
***
<p>EduAR aims to make learning more fun, interactive and innovative for children between the ages of 5-11.
<br/><br/>
It does this by providing an augmented reality tool for teachers to use. Teachers can create a scenario using a library of figures, giving these figures some tasks. An  example of a task is a quiz giver. This figure will ask questions that the children can then answer.</p>
